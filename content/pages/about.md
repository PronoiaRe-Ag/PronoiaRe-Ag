          **What is Regenerative Agriculture?**


          Regenerative agriculture is not a ‘one size fits all’ approach to
          farming or land management. It is principles and practices that
          enhance and restore strong, healthy ecosystems (like soils). Together,
          these have benefits for the farmer in terms of productivity and
          profitability, but also have long-term ecological benefits and support
          a healthy agricultural landscape.
