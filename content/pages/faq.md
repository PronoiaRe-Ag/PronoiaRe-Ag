      FAQ Regenerative Agriculture
  - type: faq_section
    section_id: faq_section
    questions:
      - question: What is Regenerative Agriculture?
        answer: >
          *   Regenerative agriculture is not a ‘one size fits all’ approach to
          farming or land management. It is principles and practices that
          enhance and restore strong, healthy ecosystems (like soils). Together,
          these have benefits for the farmer in terms of productivity and
          profitability, but also have long-term ecological benefits and support
          a healthy agricultural landscape.
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >
          Applying organic composts, fertilisers and bio-amendments


          *   Encouraging natural biological cycles and nutrient transfer


          *   Adopting holistic management


          *   Implementing time-controlled planned grazing


          *   Using grazing management and animal impact as farm and ecosystem
          development tools


          *   Retaining stubble or performing biological stubble breakdown


          *   Constructing interventions in the landscape or waterways to slow
          or capture the flow of water


          *   Fencing off waterways and implementing water reticulation for
          stock


          *   Investing in revegetation


          *   Pasture cropping


          *   Direct-drill cropping and pasture sowing


          *   Changing crop rotations


          *   Incorporating green manure or under-sowing of legumes


          *   Managing for increasing species diversity


          *   Reducing or ceasing synthetic chemical inputs


          *   Integrating enterprises
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?
        answer: >
          Increased productivity, leading to increased profits


          *   Improved soil health – structural, chemical and biological
          properties


          *   Supporting a diversity of vegetation to moderate temperatures,
          provide habitat and build resilience


          *   Sequestering greater amounts of carbon from the atmosphere


          *   Retaining more water in the soil for uptake by plants and animals
          – extending the growing season


          *   Supporting health and biodiversity in soil microbes


          *   Facilitating healthy nutrient cycling


          *   Producing more nutrient-rich vegetation and livestock


          *   Producing healthier, more nutritious food and livestock, and
          therefore healthier people


          *   Regenerating, rather than degrading, the natural resource base


          *   Building a landscape which is more resilient, especially to
          climate extremes (such as flood, drought and fire),able to recover
          more quickly


          *   Reducing input costs


          *   Enabling sustainable production


          *   Smoothing out production and profit peaks and troughs


          *   Applying techniques that could sustainably feed growing global
          populations
